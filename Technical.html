            </li>
            <h3>Server-Side Development</h3>
            <li>
              <b>Definition:</b>  Server-side development involves activities that occur on the web server, managing and processing data, handling requests, and performing various server-related operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Technologies:</b> Server-side languages such as PHP, Python (Django), Ruby (Ruby on Rails), Java (Spring), and JavaScript (Node.js).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Advantages</b> <br>Enhanced security as sensitive operations are performed on the server. <br>centralized control over data and business logic. <br>Better scalability for handling a large number of users.
            </li>
            <h3>Interaction Between Client-Side and Server-Side</h3>

          <h3>Internet Basics:</h3>
          <li>Global network of interconnected computers</li>
          <li>Enables communication, information sharing and collaboration.</li>
          <h3>Evolution of the World Wide Web</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Historical Development:</b> Birth of the World Wide Web (WWW) by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. <br> The birth of the Internet can be traced back to the late 1960s and early 1970s with the development of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), a pioneering network that laid the groundwork for the interconnected global network we know today. Here are key milestones in the birth and early development of the Internet.
            <br> <b>Arpanet Creation (1969):</b> ARPANET, the first packet-switching network, was developed by the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now DARPA). <br>On October 29, 1969, ARPANET's first message was sent between two computers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). The message was "LOGIN.
            <b>Development of TCP/IP (1970s):</b> The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) were developed by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn. <br> TCP/IP became the standardized communications protocol suite for ARPANET, forming the foundation for the entire Internet.
            <h3>Key Internet Protocol</h3>
            <li><b>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</b> <br>Foundation of data communication on the web. <br>Defines how messages are formatted and transmitted</li>
            <li><b>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):</b> <br>Secure version of HTTP using encryption (SSL/TLS). <br>Ensure secure data transfer, especially for sensitive information.</li>
            <li><b>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):</b><br>Fundamental suite of protocols for internet communication. <br>Facilitates reliable data transmission between connected devices.</li>
            <h3>Client-Server Architecture</h3>
            <li><b>Roles:</b><br>Client request services or resources. <br>Servers provide requested services or resources.</li>
            <li><b>Request-Response Cycle:</b><br>Client send request to servers. <br>Servers process requests and send back responses.</li>
            <li><b>Statelessness:</b><br>Each request from a client to a server is independent. <br>No retention of client state between requests</li>
            <h3>Internet Technologies</h3>
            <li><b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</b><br>Standard markup language for creating web pages. <br>Defines structure and layout using tags.</li>
            <li><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</b><br>Style sheet language for describing the presentation of a document. <br>Enhances the visual presentation of HTML elements.</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript:</b><br>Programming language that enables dynamic content on web pages. <br>Enhances interactivity and user experience</li>
            <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
            <li><b>Importance:</b><br>Ensures web applications work well on various devices and screen sizes. <br>Enhances user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.</li>
            <li><b>Media Queries:</b><br>CSS technique for applying styles based on device characteristics. <br>CSS technique for applying styles based on device characteristics.</li>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <li><b>Key Takeaways:</b><br>The Internet is a global network connecting computers. <br>The World Wide Web facilitates information sharing and dynamic content. <br>Protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP/IP underpin internet communication. <br>Client-server architecture involves clients making requests and servers providing responses.</li>

          <h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</h3>
          <p>
            HTML is the standard markp language used to create the structure and content of web pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, and it introduces new features and improvements over its predecessors.
          </p>
          <p>
            It provides tags and attributes that define the various elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML5 also includes new elements like header, nav, article, section, footer, which help in structuring the content more semantically.
          </p>

          <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h3>
          <p>Css is used to style and layout the visual presentation of HTML documents.</p>
          <p>It allows you to control the colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements on a web page.</p>
          <p>Css is applied either internally within an Html document, externally in separate stylesheet file, or inline within HTML tags.</p>

          <h3>Javasscript</h3>
          <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables dynamic and interactive behavior on web pages.</p>
          <p>It can manipulate the content and structure of HTML, handle user input, and communicate with servers (Ajax).</p>
          <p>JavaScript is commonly used to create features like sliders, form validation, pop-up messages, and more.</p>
          <p>It can be included directly within HTML documents or linked externally.</p>

            <b>1. Add & Commit</b> <br>
            You have have added and committed the files this way multiple times, but what if I tell you it can be done in one line with the `-am` flag?
          </p>
          <code>$ git add .
            $ git commit -m "new project"</code>

          <p>
            Try this instead, and it will add the file changes and create the commit using the message.
          </p>
          <code>$ git commit -am "new project"

            [master 17d7675] new project
            4 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)</code>
          <p>
            <b>2. Amend</b> <br>You can rename your current commit message using the '--amend' flag and write the new message. This will help you with accidental messages. 
          </p>

          <code>$ git commit --amend -m "Love"

            [master 7b7f891] Love

            4 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)</code
          >
          <p>You can include additional changes to the current commit before pushing it to the remote repository. To do so, you need to add the file changes and then commit using the `--amend` flag. To retain the previous commit message, simply use the `--no-edit` flag.</p>
          <code>$ git add . 
            $ git commit --amend --no-edit
            
            [master f425059] Love

            6 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 34 deletions(-)</code>
          
          <p><b>3. Revert</b> <br>To undo in Git, you can use the 'revert' command. However, this command does not remove any commits. Instead, it creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by the original commit. <br><br>We will use the 'log' with '--oneline' flag to view commit history in a shorter form.</p>
